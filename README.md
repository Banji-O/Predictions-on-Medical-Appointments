## Dataset
Dataset of medical appointments of some neighbourhoods in Brazil will be investigated in this project. The dataset contains some medical information on medical appointments of over one hundred thousand `(100,000)` patients, in some selected Brazilian neighbourhoods.

## Summary of Findings
At the end of the analysis it is deduced that the most populated neighbourhood; Jardim Camburi with 7717 patients, will possibly have more number of patients present on scheduled day. In terms of gender, female patients are likely to be available on scheduled day having 65% of the population compared to male patients with 35% population. Patients are more likely to be present on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Mondays, Fridays, and Thursdays respectively. Saturdays and Sundays are days that patients might not go for medical appointment. From findings, it is easier to suggest that patients that are not on scholarship and not receiving sms message will most likely be present on scheduled day.


## Key Insights 

* It is evident from the analyses and the resultant visuals that `Jardim Camburi` neighbourhood with 7717 patients is the neighbourhood with highest population. `Parque Industrial` neighbourhood with 1 patient is the neighbourhood with least population.

* Female population comprises 65% of the entire population, while male population comprises 35% of the entire population.

* There is positive relationship between male population and female population on scheduled day. As the male population increases, so also the female population.

* Adult population is slightly higher than young population. This implies that there will be more adults on scheduled day than younger people.

* Tuesdays are the days most likely to have highest number of patients in the week. The number would likely drop on Wednesdays, Mondays, and maintain the downward trend.

* Over 90% of patients on scheduled day are not enrolled in the scholarship program. Compared to those enrolled that are less than 10%.
